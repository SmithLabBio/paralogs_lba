# Paralogs and long-branch attraction

Scripts for paper "Using paralogs for phylogenetic inference mitigates the effects of long-branch attraction"

## Simulation Studies

We use the script usage.py for simulations.
This script relies on modules from simulate_data.py.
Both of these scripts must be in the working directory.
As input, this script takes a configuration files.
The configuration files used here are in the config_files folder.
Each is described below, and the command used to run the scirpt is shown.

### Varying the internal branch length *r* and the branch length multipliers for long branches *q*
